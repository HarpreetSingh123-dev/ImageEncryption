# ImageEncryption
The encryptImage function in the above example accepts an ImageData object as input, which stands for an image's pixel data. The image data is transformed into an array of pixels, and then each pixel value is subjected to an encryption procedure. Your requirements can be taken into account while customising the encryption process.

The reverse decryption procedure is carried out on each pixel value in the encrypted ImageData object by the decryptImage function in order to recover the original image data.

The usage example loads an image, encrypts it using the encryptImage function, decrypts it using the decryptImage function, and then displays the decrypted image on a canvas.
